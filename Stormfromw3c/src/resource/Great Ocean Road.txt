Great Ocean Road  @ Lorne Pier http://t.co/XZNhLLb2
In Melbourne. Had a slight issue with the place we're staying at but all good. Great Ocean Road drive tomorrow.
Had an incredible couple of days along the Great Ocean Road! The 12 Apostles were really stunning http://t.co/jdkLbJb9
@pattiw23 This was right outside of Melbourne on the Great Ocean Road. It's the 12 Apostles. It was breath taking!
